**In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) 
institute in Queensland, Australia. We can find the TAFE exit survey here and the survey for the DETE here.**
**In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:**
  **1.Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there 
  longer?**
  **2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?**
